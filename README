__PROGRAM_NAME__ __PROGRAM_VERSION__

Saves tabs opened in Firefox to a file in some format.

It takes Firefox file with actual configuration of opened tabs and
windows, finds titles and urls there and saves these pairs to a file
in a selected format.

Some file formats are mutable, some not and some are both mutable and
immutable.

Available formats:

  text -- a text file
          a raw format, it is handy for automatic processing

  html -- a html page
          it is handy for read, but it is closed for editions

   org -- org-file for Emacs
          it is handy for read, also it is handy for editions
          (recommended)

========================================================================

0. REQUIREMENTS

This program has tested in Linux Fedora 20 and Mozilla Firefox 38.0.5.

It may work with lower versions of Firefox and may not work with
higher versions of Firefox due uncontrolled changes made in the
browser.

For other systems (macOS, Windows) this program wasn't tested and may
work, but it is not guaranteed.

Also to install program you should have folder `Downloads' in your
home directory because shell scripts save output files there.


1. CONFIGURATION

To configure Makefile for building the program run:

  ./configure

Another configuration of this program is automated in Makefile.
Run `make help' to know available commands.


2. BUILDING

At first, you should build the program, run:

   `make'

It will create the `build' directory with files and directories ready
for installation.

You can take these files directly, as they are ready for using.

Also this file and another documentation can hold templates in the
form `__NAME_OF_TEMPLATE__' so it is not clear what is this. But after
building they are replaced and you can read everything. So if you
don't understand any info because of them, look into the building
directory, it will be there clear.


3. INSTALLATION

3.1 General installation

When the program has built, you can install it, run:

   `sudo make install'

By default the python script will be installed to the `/usr/local/bin'
directory.
By default shell scripts will be installed to the `/usr/local/bin'
directory.

3.2 Installation to custom directories

You can also replace build and install directories from the command
line.

To change a default directory to a custom directory, just run:

  `make "build_dir=mydir"'  (default `build')

  `make "docs_dir=mydir"'  (default `docs')

  `sudo make "python_script_dir=mydir" install'  (default `/usr/local/bin')

  `sudo make "shell_scripts_dir=mydir" install'  (default `/usr/local/bin')

  `sudo make "system_docs_dir=mydir" install'  (default `/usr/share/doc')

If you have built a custom directory, then while installation in some
cases you should pass it again because make doesn't remember it.

3.3 How to uninstall the program

To uninstall the program run command:

  `sudo make uninstall'

If the program was installed to custom directories, you should pass
these directories through variables to `make'.

Note: After uninstall all users in the system can't use the program
because it has deleted.


4. OPERATING

Most information how to operate with the program you can read in the
help of __PROGRAM_NAME__.py. Just run:

  `__PROGRAM_NAME__.py -h'

Some shell scripts are already operating with the main program. By
default they are installed in `/usr/local/bin' and have prefix
"__PROGRAM_NAME__" in their names.

So, you can run:

  `__PROGRAM_NAME__.sh'

to save Firefox urls in a default format (org-file).

Also you can run:

  `__PROGRAM_NAME__-text.sh' or `__PROGRAM_NAME__-html.sh' or `__PROGRAM_NAME__-org.sh'

to select output file format - text-file, html-file or org-file.

Usually, you will save Firefox urls through `__PROGRAM_NAME__.sh' since it was
made special for that. But in some cases you will want simple
text-file or read-only html-file or forced org-file or even Firefox
will change the path to its files after update (as it happens
sometimes), so you will need to use the main program to set the new
Firefox data path. If this happens, make your own shell script, using
contents of existing scripts as an example.


5. FILES

README            This file.

README.md         The file with project description in markdown.
                  Needed for automatic description generated on web.

LICENSE           The text of license.

__PROGRAM_NAME__.py         The main program which parses Firefox file and saves
                  output.

__PROGRAM_NAME__.sh         The shell script for run default shell script
                  (`__PROGRAM_NAME__-org.sh').

These shell scripts will be renamed after installation for
convenient using:

__PROGRAM_NAME__-text.sh    The shell script for run `__PROGRAM_NAME__.py' and save to text
                  output.

__PROGRAM_NAME__-html.sh    The shell script for run `__PROGRAM_NAME__.py' and save to html
                  output.

__PROGRAM_NAME__-org.sh     The shell script for run `__PROGRAM_NAME__.py' and save to org
                  output.

Other files exist for building the program.

10. TROUBLESHOOTING

1)
Firefox can change its format (I caught such a case one time), so
the program can lose the input file. If so, edit shell scripts or run
`__PROGRAM_NAME__.py' manually with the new input file.

2)
In some cases Firefox behaves like it has open tabs, but don't make
the file with them, or it makes this file, but there are empty links
or not all links. In such a case you should wait some time (a minute)
until Firefox creates it normally. It is a recovery file, therefore it
may work with a delay.

Same thing may happen when you try to save tabs when Firefox is not
running. It may delete this file or the file contains wrong links. In
this case just open links in Firefox and wait a minute until it will
be ready and then save.

3)
If the program prints a weird message that it can't save the output
file, then check existence of the `~/Downloads' directory.
