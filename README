__PROGRAM_NAME__ __PROGRAM_VERSION__

Saves tabs opened in Firefox to a file in some format.

It takes Firefox file with actual configuration of opened tabs and
windows, finds titles and urls there and saves these pairs to a file
in a selected format.

Some file formats are mutable, some not and some are both mutable and
immutable.

Available formats:

  text -- a text file
          a raw format, it is handy for automatic processing

  html -- a html page
          it is handy for read, but it is closed for editions

   org -- org-file for Emacs
          it is handy for read, also it is handy for editions
          (recommended)

========================================================================

1. CONFIGURATION

Configuration of this program is automated in Makefile.
Run `make help' to know available commands.


2. INSTALLATION

2.1 General installation

At first, you should build program:

   `make' or `make build'

When the program is built, you can install:

   `sudo make install'

It can't be installed if it wasn't built.

By default the python script will be installed to /usr/local/bin
directory.
By default shell scripts will be installed to $HOME/.env/scripts
directory.

To uninstall the program run command:

  `sudo make uninstall'


2.2 Installation to custom directories

You can also replace build and install directories from the command
line.

Just run to change the build directory:

  `make "build_dir=mydir" build'

Just run to change the home directory:

  `make "home_dir=mydir" install'

Just run to change the python script install directory:

  `make "python_script_dir=mydir" install'

Just run to change the shell scripts install directory:

  `make "shell_scripts_dir=mydir" install'

Just run to change the program docs directory:

  `make "docs_dir=mydir" build'

If you have built custom `docs_dir', then while installation you
should pass it again.

Just run to change the system docs directory:

  `make "system_docs_dir=mydir" install'


3. OPERATING

How to operate with the program you can read in the help of ffurls.py.
Just run:

  `ffurls.py -h'

Some shell scripts are already operating with the main program. By
default they are installed in `~/.env/scripts' and have prefix "ffurls"
in their names.

So, you can run:

  `ffurls.sh'

to save Firefox urls in default format (org-file).

Also you can run:

  `ffurlst.sh' or `ffurlsh.sh' or `ffurlso.sh'

to select output file format - text-file, html-file or org-file.

Usually you will save Firefox urls through `ffurls.sh' since it was
made special for that. But in some cases you will want simple
text-file or read-only html-file or forced org-file or even Firefox
will change the path to its files after update (as it happens
sometimes), so you will need to use the main program to set new
Firefox data path. If this will happen, make your own shell script,
using existing scripts.


4. FILES

README          --  This file.
LICENSE         --  The text of license.

ffurls.py       --  The main program which parses Firefox file and saves output.
ffurls.sh       --  The shell script for run defualt shell script (ffurls-org.sh).

These shell scripts will be renamed after installation for convenience:

ffurls-text.sh  --  The shell script for run ffurls.py and save to text output.
                    will be renamed to ffurlst.sh
ffurls-html.sh  --  The shell script for run ffurls.py and save to html output.
                    will be renamed to ffurlsh.sh
ffurls-org.sh   --  The shell script for run ffurls.py and save to org output.
                    will be renamed to ffurlso.sh

Other files are for building the program.

8. BUGS

Contact for bugs is unavailable at the moment. There is no stable
contact address created yet.


9. TROUBLESHOOTING

Firefox can change its format (I caught such a case one time), so the
program could lost the input file. If so, edit shell scripts or run
`ffurls.py' manually with the new input file.
