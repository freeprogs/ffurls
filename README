Saves tabs opened in Firefox to a file in some format.

It takes Firefox file with actual configuration of opened tabs and
windows, finds titles and urls there and saves these pairs to a file
in a selected format.

Available formats:

  text -- a text file
          a raw format, it is handy for automatic processing

  html -- a html page
          it is handy for read, but it is closed for editions

   org -- org-file for Emacs
          it is handy for read, also it is handy for editions

0. REQUIREMENTS

This program has tested on environment configuration
1)
  Linux Fedora 20
  Python 3.3.2
  Mozilla Firefox 38.0.5
  GNU bash 4.4.12
2)
  Linux Fedora 26
  Python 3.6.5 with package lz 2.1.0
  Mozilla Firefox 60.0.0
  GNU bash 4.4.12

It may work with lower versions of Firefox and may not work with
higher versions of Firefox due uncontrolled changes were made in the
browser.

For other systems (macOS, Windows) this program wasn't tested and may
work, but it is not guaranteed.


1. CONFIGURATION

To configure Makefile for building the program run:

  ./configure

Another configuration of this program is automated in Makefile.
Run `make help' to know available commands.


2. BUILDING

At first, you should build the program, run:

   `make'

It will create the `build' directory with files and directories ready
for installation.
You can read these files since they don't contain m4-template strings
anymore and ready for installation and work.


3. INSTALLATION

3.1 General installation

When the program has built, you can install it, run:

   `sudo make install'

By default the shell script will be installed to the `__DNAME_SHBIN__'
directory.
By default the python script will be installed to the `__DNAME_PYBIN__'
directory.
By default the config file will be installed to the `__DNAME_ETC_CONFIG__'
directory.
By default the documentation will be installed to the `__DNAME_DOC__/__PROGRAM_NAME__'
directory.

3.3 How to uninstall the program

To uninstall the program run command:

  `sudo make uninstall'


4. OPERATING

Most information how to operate with the program you can read in the
help of __FNAME_GENERAL_SH__. Just run:

  `__FNAME_GENERAL_SH__ --help'

Low level scripts __FNAME_PARSE_PY__ and __FNAME_UNZIP_PY__ also
contains help information. Just run:

  `__FNAME_PARSE_PY__ -h'

  `__FNAME_UNZIP_PY__ -h'

In usual case the program takes its configuration from __FNAME_ETC_CONFIG__
and you just run:

  `__FNAME_GENERAL_SH__'

to save Firefox urls to default directory, filename, file extension
and format.


5. FILES

After installation you have files:

__DNAME_DOC__/__PROGRAM_NAME__
  documentation (help, versions history and license)

__FNAME_GENERAL_SH__
  The main program which parses Firefox file with tabs and saves
  output to the output file.

__FNAME_ETC_CONFIG__
  Configurations file for all system users.

__FNAME_PARSE_PY__
  Low level script for getting tabs from json.

__FNAME_UNZIP_PY__
  Low level script for getting json from compressed json.

10. TROUBLESHOOTING

1)
Firefox can change its format (I caught such a case one time), so
the program can lose the input file.
If so, you can take Firefox file with json manually and run
`__FNAME_PARSE_PY__' manually to get the output file.

2)
In some cases Firefox behaves like it has open tabs, but don't make
the file with them, or it makes this file, but there are empty links
or not all links. In such a case you should wait some time (over ten
seconds) until Firefox creates it normally. It is a recovery file,
therefore it may work with a delay.

Same thing may happen when you try to save tabs when Firefox is not
running. It may delete this file or the file contains wrong links. In
this case just open links in Firefox and wait half a minute until it
will be ready and then save.

3)
If the program prints a weird message that it can't save the output
file, then check existence of the output directory and permissions for
creating output file there.
